## Code Explanation

- `print()` is a built-in Python function that outputs the specified message to the screen.
- In this script, it prints the string `"Hello, world!"` when you run the file.
- Strings in Python are enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

## Expected Output

```
Hello, world!
Welcome to Python programming!
2024
```
