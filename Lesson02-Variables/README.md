# Lesson02-Variables

This lesson demonstrates how to declare and use variables in Python. Variables are containers for storing data values and are fundamental to programming.

## Key Concepts

- Declaring variables using the assignment operator (`=`)
- Variable naming conventions in Python
- Storing and retrieving values from variables
- Variables can hold different types of data

## Code Explanation

- `message` is a variable that stores the string `"This is a string variable!"`.
- The `print(message)` statement outputs the value of the variable to the console.
- Variables in Python don't require type declarationsâ€”Python automatically determines the type based on the value assigned.
- Variable names should be descriptive and follow Python conventions (lowercase with underscores for multiple words).

## Expected Output

```
This is a string variable!
The message has changed!

Name: Alice
Age: 25
Height: 5.6 feet
Is student: True

Alice was born in 1999
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson02-Variables` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 Lesson02-Variables.py
   ```

You should see the output:

```
This is a string variable!
```
