# Lesson18-LambdaMapFilter

This lesson introduces lambda (anonymous) functions and the built-in `map()` and `filter()` functions in Python. It explains how to use lambda functions for concise, one-off operations and how to process data functionally with map and filter.

## Key Concepts

- Lambda functions: anonymous, inline functions
- Lambda syntax: `lambda arguments: expression`
- Using `map()` to transform all items in an iterable
- Using `filter()` to select items based on a condition
- Functional programming concepts in Python
- When to use lambda vs. regular functions

## Code Explanation

The script demonstrates:
- How to define and use a lambda function.
- How to use map() to apply a function to every item in a list.
- How to use filter() to select items from a list based on a condition.
- The difference between using lambda functions and regular functions in these contexts.
- Lambda functions are best for simple, one-line operations.

## Expected Output

```
Square of 5: 25
Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Even numbers: [2, 4]
Cubes: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson18-LambdaMapFilter` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 Lesson18-LambdaMapFilter.py
   ```

````
   ```

Observe the output to see how lambda functions, map, and filter work in Python.
