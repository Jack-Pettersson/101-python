# Lesson04-IfStatements

This lesson introduces if statements in Python. It explains how to use conditional logic to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.

## Key Concepts

- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional branching
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Boolean expressions and truthiness
- Code indentation in Python (4 spaces)

## Code Explanation

The script demonstrates:
- How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions based on conditions.
- How comparison operators (like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are used in conditions.
- How the program executes different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false.
- You can modify the `number` variable to test different conditions.

## Expected Output

With the default values in the script:

```
=== EXAMPLE 1: Basic If-Elif-Else ===

10 is positive.

=== EXAMPLE 2: Comparison Operators ===

Age 18: You are an adult.

=== EXAMPLE 3: Multiple Conditions ===

The weather is nice.

=== EXAMPLE 4: Logical Operators (and, or, not) ===

You can enter the venue.

=== EXAMPLE 5: Nested If Statements ===

You passed!
Grade: B
```

Try changing the values of `number`, `age`, `temperature`, `has_ticket`, `has_id`, and `score` to see different outputs!

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson04-IfStatements` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 Lesson04-IfStatements.py
   ```

Observe the output to see how the if statements work.
