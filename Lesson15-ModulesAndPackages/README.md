# Lesson15-ModulesAndPackages

This lesson introduces modules and packages in Python. It explains how to organize code into multiple files, import your own modules, and structure packages for larger projects, which is essential for building scalable applications.

## Key Concepts

- Creating custom modules (.py files)
- Importing from custom modules
- Understanding packages (directories with `__init__.py`)
- Relative imports within packages
- Code organization and reusability
- The difference between modules and packages

## Code Explanation

The script demonstrates:
- How to create and import your own module.
- How to structure a simple package with an `__init__.py` file.
- How to use functions from another file or package.
- The `__init__.py` file makes a directory a Python package and can control what gets imported.

## Expected Output

```
Hello from mymodule, Alice!
Hello from submodule, Bob!
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson15-ModulesAndPackages` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

````
   ```

Observe the output to see how modules and packages work in Python.
