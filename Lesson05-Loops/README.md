# Lesson05-Loops

This lesson introduces loops in Python. It explains how to use `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions multiple times, which is essential for automating repetitive tasks.

## Key Concepts

- Using `for` loops to iterate over sequences (lists, ranges, strings)
- Using `while` loops for condition-based repetition
- The `range()` function for generating number sequences
- Loop control: `break` (exit loop) and `continue` (skip iteration)
- Nested loops (loops inside loops)
- Loop iteration variables

## Code Explanation

The script demonstrates:
- **For loop with range()**: Iterating over a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5.
- **For loop over a list**: Iterating directly over list elements.
- **For loop over a string**: Iterating through each character.
- **While loop**: Repeating actions while a condition remains true.
- **Break statement**: Exiting a loop early when a condition is met.
- **Continue statement**: Skipping the current iteration and moving to the next.
- **Nested loops**: Using loops inside other loops for complex iterations.

## Expected Output

```
=== EXAMPLE 1: For Loop with Range ===

Counting from 1 to 5:
1
2
3
4
5

=== EXAMPLE 2: For Loop with List ===

Iterating over a list of fruits:
I like apples
I like bananas
I like cherrys
I like oranges

=== EXAMPLE 3: For Loop with String ===

Spelling out PYTHON:
P
Y
T
H
O
N

=== EXAMPLE 4: While Loop ===

Counting down from 5:
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!

=== EXAMPLE 5: Loop with Break ===

Searching for the number 7:
Checking 1...
Checking 2...
Checking 3...
Checking 4...
Checking 5...
Checking 6...
Checking 7...
Found it!

=== EXAMPLE 6: Loop with Continue ===

Print only odd numbers from 1 to 10:
1
3
5
7
9

=== EXAMPLE 7: Nested Loops ===

Multiplication table (1-3):
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6

3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9

```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson05-Loops` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 Lesson05-Loops.py
   ```

````
   ```

Observe the output to see how the loops work.
