# Lesson17-ListComprehensions

This lesson introduces list comprehensions in Python. It explains how to create lists in a concise and Pythonic way, including filtering and transforming data, which is a powerful feature for writing clean code.

## Key Concepts

- Basic list comprehension syntax: `[expression for item in iterable]`
- Conditional list comprehensions: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`
- Transforming data with list comprehensions
- Comparing list comprehensions to traditional for loops
- When to use list comprehensions vs. regular loops

## Code Explanation

The script demonstrates:
- How to use a basic list comprehension to create a new list.
- How to use list comprehensions with conditions (filtering).
- Transforming data in a list comprehension.
- The difference between list comprehensions and traditional for loops for creating lists (shown in the script).

## Expected Output

```
Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Even squares: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
Uppercase words: ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']
Cubes (traditional loop): [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson17-ListComprehensions` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 Lesson17-ListComprehensions.py
   ```

````
   ```

Observe the output to see how list comprehensions work in Python.
