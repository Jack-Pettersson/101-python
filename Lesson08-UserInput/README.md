# Lesson08-UserInput

This lesson introduces user input in Python. It explains how to use the `input()` function to get information from the user and how to process and validate that input.

## Key Concepts

- Using the `input()` function to get user input
- Input always returns a string by default
- Type conversion: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Using f-strings for formatted output
- Combining user input with program logic

## Code Explanation

The script demonstrates:
- How to prompt the user for input using `input()`.
- How to store and use the input value in your program.
- How to convert input from a string to another data type (like `int()` or `float()`).
- How to use user input in calculations or output.

## Expected Output

The program will prompt you for input. Here's an example interaction:

```
=== EXAMPLE 1: String Input ===

What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.

=== EXAMPLE 2: Integer Input with Conversion ===

How old are you? 25
You are 25 years old.
You were born in approximately 2000.

=== EXAMPLE 3: Float Input with Calculations ===

Enter a number to double: 7.5
Twice your number is 15.0

=== EXAMPLE 4: Multiple Inputs ===

What's your favorite color? blue
What's your favorite food? pizza

Great! Your favorite color is blue and you love pizza.

=== EXAMPLE 5: Yes/No Input ===

Do you like Python? (yes/no): yes
That's awesome! Python is a great language!

=== EXAMPLE 6: Building a Simple Calculator ===

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): *
10.0 * 3.0 = 30.0
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Lesson08-UserInput` directory.
2. Run the script with:

   ```sh
   python3 Lesson08-UserInput.py
   ```

````
   ```

Follow the prompts and enter values to see how user input works.
